       "  \"Cambridge Journal of Economics 1979, 3, 1-14Stagnation theory and stagnation policyJosef Steindl*Following the traditions of Kalecki and Keynes, we are led to believe that a high long-term rate of growth is necessary to establish an adequate use of capacity and fullemployment, because somehow our economy is rather inflexibly adjusted to such highlong-term rates of growth. In this line is Harrod's theory (Harrod, 1939, 1948), as wellas my own Maturity and Stagnation (Steindl, 1952). Both explain the secular depression ofthe pre-war decade in these terms: the economy is unable to adjust to low growth ratesbecause its savings propensity is adapted to a high one.From this point of view it is not, in principle, difficult to understand how the pre-warconditions of under-use of resources were avoided after the last war; a very high long-term rate of growth imposed by certain favourable exogenous conditions on thepost-war economy made it work.In the course of the 1970s we have entered a new era, dominated by the convictionthat in the future the long-term rate of growth is going to be much lowerŠor that itshould be lower or must be lowerŠa belief which in the nature of things carries a greatdeal of self-fulfillment within it. In consequence, under-use of resources already existson a large scale. Thus the climate has changed twice: from the pre-war depression to thepost-war high growth period of the 1950s and 1960s, and from that back again to theperiod of stunted growth in the 1970s. The two periodsŠhigh growth and stuntedgrowthŠrequire an explanation which links one to the other and reconciles them withthe model of development before World War II which I used in Maturity and Stagnation.Before I try to do that in the second part of the paper, I want to deal with some aspectsof my maturity theory which are related to well known ideas in the contemporaryliterature. Perhaps some of my concepts will become easier to understand in this way,and in any event I shall have a formal apparatus to serve me in dealing with the difficultproblems of the post-war scene.1. The maturity theoremHarrod's equation of 1939 implies a kind of maturity theorem, although he did not usethis word. I shall write his equation in a slightly modified form, putting:Y = gross product in real terms,T* = capacity production in real terms,* Honorary Professor, University of Vienna; Consultant, Austrian Institute of Economic Research.

(4)From the definition of utilisation, gross investment and gross saving (equations (1), (2)and (3) respectively), we derive the extended Harrod equation (4). It differs fromHarrod\\'s equation in so far as he used the capital-output ratio, which can be considereda product of the capital-capacity output ratio and the degree of utilisation of capacity.I introduce these two factors separately, because the capital-capacity ratio is a techno-logical element, whereas the degree of utilisation reflects the state of effective demand.Another difference is that I formulate the equation in terms of gross investment andsaving. Harrod assumed that the drop out of equipment and the depreciation are alwaysequal, and he therefore formulated his equation in terms of net investment and saving.The last term in (4), therefore, does not appear in his formulation. In a later paper(Harrod, 1970), Harrod recognised that linear depreciation will be greater than thedrop-out of equipment in a growing economy, and A. Bhaduri has provided an elegantmathematical treatment of these relationships (Bhaduri, 1972). For a uniform expectedlife-time ri the depreciation ratio d\\' is the reciprocal of this expected life-time (d\\'=l/n\\')and it is applied to gross capital vY*(t). (For heterogeneous equipment with differentlife-times d\\' will be reciprocal of the weighted harmonious mean of the different life-times.) Drop-out as a proportion of gross capital will depend on the actual life-time nand also on the rate of growth of capital r in the preceding n years. We therefore writethe drop-out ratio d{r) as a function of the growth rate r. For steady state growth d(r)will be given by (Bhaduri, 1972)d{r) = re-\"\\'/(I-e-\"\\'),d{r) < 1/nfor r> 0,d{r) = I In for r = 0.d(r) is a decreasing function of r. Thus, the greater the accumulation during the precedinglife-time n of the equipment, the greater will be the discrepancy between depreciation',\n",

       "  \"Stagnation theory and policy 3and drop-out. The two ratios will be equal only in the stationary state, provided thatexpected and actual (ex post) life-times are equal. In the context of this paper interestcentres on the premature or delayed withdrawal of equipment which may prevail indifferent situations; in other words, on (temporary) changes in actual life-times whichtake place against a background of unchanged depreciation rates. For the moment weshall disregard the question of drop-out and depreciation altogether and return to itlater.In equilibrium utilisation will be constant and the first term on the right of (4) willvanish. Starting from this position, let us suppose that the rate of growth is reduced to alower level by certain exogenous influences; utilisation will then decline until it reachesa level at which equilibrium is again established. If the lower utilisation, however, reactsunfavourably on investment, the left-hand side of the equation (4) will again decline anda process of continuing decline of growth will be set in motion. The reverse process willtake place if the growth rate is lifted from equilibrium to a higher level, subject to\\\\thequalification that the ceiling of capacity production cannot be surpassed. Writing in the1930s Harrod had in mind the downward process. If the system had been adjusted, byits rigid saving ratio, to a high rate of growth, and if at a later dateŠwhether fordemographic reasons or because of a slowing of technical progressŠa lower growth rateobtained, secular depression would prevail.Stepping now outside Harrod's text, we may say that the saving ratio, of course,depends on the share of profits in the national income, and its rigidity ultimatelyreflects the rigidity of the income distribution. How far does this rigidity hold and onwhat does it depend? The share of profits in the short run (in the course of the cycle) isstrongly influenced by utilisation. To separate this influence let me represent, for aclosed system, the relation of wages and salaries (W), net profits (P) and income {Y) in away strongly reminiscent of Kalecki (1954, p. 40):W+P = T-d'vT*.W = AT+fiT*, T < T*. (5)The two terms on the right-hand side of (5) represent the contribution of direct labourand overhead labour; the latter is assumed to move in proportion to production capacity.We are now going to express profits and savings as ratios of capacity production. Itwould be more in keeping with common usage to express them as ratios of the (net)capital stock, in other words, as profit rate and a corresponding 'saving rate'. However,in order to avoid introducing an additional variable with its own problems, it is prefer-able to work with the capacity production as a proxy for the capital stock.We obtain then from (5) the net profit after depreciationp = (i-X)r-fiT*-d'vr*, (r < r*), (6)P\\\\Y* = (\\\\-X)u-n-d'v =p(u). (7)p(u), an increasing function of utilisation, will be called the profit function. This functionplays an essential role in what follows. We need it to distinguish between those shifts toor from profits which are due to effective demand, and those which result from changedprice-cost relations independent of demand. The neoclassical tradition now en voguetakes great delight in confusing these two cases of a shift in profit. In fact, neoclassicismdoes not admit of anything but full utilisation in the long run, and even in the short runadopts the same assumption when considering practical problems. For the Keynesiantradition, on the other hand, the concept of utilisation is of central importance.\",\n",

       "  '4 J. SteindlKalecki (1954) achieved the above-mentioned distinction by introducing the mark-up of prices on prime cost. A shift to profits could occur through an increase eitherin mark-up or in demand. The above concept of the profit function is plainly aimingat a more general (less specific) formulation of the same idea.We now derive gross saving, which consists of the gross savings of capitalistsS\\' = [slp(u)+d\\'o\\\\r*and the savings of employeesS\" =s2[u-p(u)-d\\'v] T*.S = S\\'+S\\\\Thus we get gross saving as a ratio of capacity output, which we call the savings functions(u):s(u) = S/r* = {Sl-s2) p(u) +d\\'v + si(u-d\\'v) (8)or, alternatively, inserting the expression (7) for p(u):Si)d\\'B- (8a)It can easily be seen that the savings function is an increasing function of/>(u), providedthat sl>s2, i-e. the ratio saved out of profits is larger than the ratio saved out of wages.It is also an increasing function of u, providedThe savings function s(u) might now be inserted in the modified Harrod equation (4) inplace of the term su(J) (the constant savings-income ratio). I shall, however, choose adifferent representation, which permits us to distinguish between exogenous andendogenous influences on the growth rate.Let us simply put saving (equation (3)) equal to investment (equation (2)). Invest-ment consists of a part which generates new capacityŠcall it I\\'(t)Šand a part whichmerely replaces equipment which drops out. This replacement is equal to I(tŠn), wheren is the life-time. The life-time is, however, not given beforehand, since obsolescenceis not \\'technological\\', but varies according to the state of business. I prefer for thisreason to denote the replacement demand, as before, by vd(r)Y*(t), i.e. as a function ofpast accumulation r which may vary according to the scarcity or abundance of equip-ment in relation to demand.We have, therefore, for the gross investment in terms of capacity output:i(t)ir*(i)=r(t)ir*(t)+vd(r). (9)Let us now suppose that the capacity-generating investment is determined by investmentdecisions taken a certain time T previously, and that these decisions depend inter alia onthe degree of utilisation, as well as on the internal saving of the enterprises S\". We thuswrite:expressing the capacity-generating investment as an increasing function 9 of pastutilisation and entrepreneurial saving. Inserting into (9) and putting investment equalto saving (8), we can write:<P[B(1-T),S\\'(*-T)] = fa-sJpluW+sJuW-d\\'ol+d\\'v-dWv-*i) vd\\'-vd(r). (10)',\n",

Let us assume for this purpose that the budget is,automatically balanced,the receipts of new or- increased taxation being spent immediately.If a uniform and proportionate tax 6 is levied on profits and if profits are positive, theprofits after tax will be (from (7))wages may be similarily taxed at a rate 6' and equation (10) will then be modified asfollows:V[u(t-r),S'{t-r)] = sJL(\\\\-k) u(.t)-(n + vd')] (1-6)+st[Au(t)+/i-vd'] (l-0')+vd'-vd(r). (11)If a profit tax 6 is newly introduced this would appear to reduce disposable income andsaving. In view of the predetermined investment (left-hand side of (10)), however,saving cannot decline. If, in the simplest case, workers' saving s2 is zero, then theutilisation will increase just enough to restore the profit after tax and the saving out of itto its former level. The profits tax will be paid out of the increase in profits beforetaxation due to the higher utilisation.If workers do save but are not taxed, their savings may increase with increasedemployment, and that means that profits after tax will not remain at their former levelbut will decrease.-The effect is, however, doubtful because the increased employmentmay increase consumers' credit and spending on durables.If wages, however, are taxed too, this counteracts the decline of profits after tax. Infact, if the tax on wages is sufficiently high, profits after tax may even increase. Inpractice, since the saving of employed people is very unequally distributed, the tax onwages will reduce it less than proportionately and will fall more on consumption, whilethe profit tax will fall largely on savings. A profits tax is therefore far more likely tostimulate demand and increase utilisation than a tax on wages. (We assume always thattax receipts are spent simultaneously).Distribution and growthWhile, in my interpretation of Harrod's world, income distribution is rigidly given anddoes not change, except to the extent to which it depends on u, we get a quite differentpicture from Kaldor's model of distribution.

       "  \"6 J. Steindlcapacity (the left-hand side of (10)) is somehow given exogenously, and the profitfunction is a variable which adjusts to it so as to produce just enough saving for thepredetermined investment.What is the mechanism underlying this idea? It will only apply, says Kaldor, if fullemployment is established. Here Kaldor refers explicitly to Keynes's 'How to Pay for theWar'. The Kaldor distribution theory differs from Keynes's theory of the inflationarygap only in so far as the former presupposes that the workers (trade unions) put up withthe shift in distribution so that no inflationary spiral arises. This is due to the long-runnature of this process, in which the distributional shift proceeds only slowly. Limits, bothupwards and downwards, to the possible adjustment of the profit shares are recognisedby Kaldor. His model today appears as a rather optimistic picture of the possible workingof full employment, written at an early stage of the period of full employment (1955).(A surprising feature of the theory is that full employmentŠor overfull employmentŠissupposed to favour a shift to profits.)In a somewhat formal way the idea of Kaldor's distribution theory runs parallel to thepicture of distribution which I gave (in Maturity and Stagnation, chs. 5 and 9) for acompetitive economy, which I suppose might have corresponded to historical reality inthe US before the emergence of oligopolistic structures. In such an economy there wouldbe a great number of producers, many of them near the margin of existence. If any ofthem acquired differential advantages by means of new methods, they would expandquickly and gain room by pushing out high cost producers. Any appearance of excep-tional profits, a very likely concomitant of technical innovation, would soon lead to anexpansion of capacity of the favoured firms, and from there to an attempt to capturemarkets from the high cost producers by cutting prices. In the long run this mechanismwould at the same time re-establish a 'normal' (desired) degree of utilisation, and reducethe profit margins to a 'normal' level. What is 'normal' in this context depends, however,on the rate of growth of capital. Referring to equation (10) we can see that if utilisationis to be kept at a certain level in the long run, then an increase (decrease) of the left-handside of the equation requires a shift upwards (downwards) of the profit function p(u).This argument is formally analogous to Kaldor's equation, but the mechanism behindit is quite different. I assume that a low growth rate, since it tends to lead to excesscapacity, sets up an increase in competitive pressure. To re-establish a normal desireddegree of utilisation, high cost producers have to be driven out, which requires a cut inthe industry's average profit margins. A high growth rate of capital, on the contrary, willlead to high utilisation and therefore a lessening of competitive pressure. There is lessneed to fight for markets by pushing out high cost producers and the average profitmargins will therefore increase.In the process of adjustment to a change in the growth rate of capital, the variation inlife-time of equipment plays a role. High growth rate and high utilisation will tend toretard withdrawal of equipment, thus lengthen actual life-time and shift the drop-outfunction d(r) downwards, so that the difference d'Šd(r) will rise above its averagelong-term level. A low growth rate and utilisation will lead to some premature with-drawal of equipment, and therefore to a decrease ofd'Šd(r) below its long-term average.Clearly these movements, in so far as they are operative, serve to accommodate theincreased or decreased growth rate. The change in the difference d'Šd(r) acts, however,only as long as the transition to a new equilibrium proceeds. This equilibrium will beestablished by a shift of the profit function p{u), and the consequent shift in the savingfunction s(u), such as to permit the re-establishment of a normal degree of utilisation at\",\n",

       "  \"Stagnation theory and policy 7the given growth rate. This is a long-run process. In the course of the trade cycle, theadjustment of utilisation prevails.The adjustment of the profit function to the growth rate must be seen against thebackground of a dynamic economy in which there is always a balance of two opposingforces. Owing to innovations, etc., there emerge again and again exceptional profits,which tend to push the profit function upwards. At the same time, owing to the aggres-siveness of expanding firms and the diffusion of previous innovations, there is a pressurewhich at the same time drives out high cost producers and lowers the profit function.According to whether growth is fast or slow, one or the other of the two tendencies willbe strengthened, and the balance will shift in one or the other direction.It should be noted that, while Kaldor is really interested mainly in the case of anupward pressure of growth rates, which maintains full employment, my own treatmentof distribution only considers the effects of a declining growth rate, simply because thiswas the problem posed by the mature economy of pre-war times.Although I devoted much effort to the description of distribution in a competitiveeconomy, my chief point was really that this mechanism no longer works very well whenan economy with many producers is superseded by an oligopolistic economy. Hereaggressive price strategies become very risky, because the few main producers all havesubstantial margins, and to drive out one of them would require a ruinous price war. Ifthe growth rate declines, the oligopolists are therefore more prepared in most cases toaccept low long-term rates of utilisation than to engage in cut-throat competition. Thatmeans that the profit function becomes fairly rigid, and the weight of adjustment isthrown on utilisation, with adverse effects on investment and further growth. We areback to Harrod's model. We might define maturity as the state in which the economyand its profit function are adjusted to the high growth rates of earlier stages of capitalistdevelopment, while those high growth rates no longer obtain.But why did the growth rate ever start to decline ? What is the reason for the initialdecline (which, as we can see from equation (10), will initiate a cumulative furtherdecline) ? I also tried to answer this more difficult question, although I cannot findparallels or support for this answer in contemporary literature. I assumed that with thetransition to an oligopolistic structure the big firms must have increased their profitmargins (mark-up); in other words, the profit function must have shifted upwards. Thiscould not increase the profits for the economy as a whole, since they are determined byinvestments, which in turn are governed by past decisions (see equation (10)). Thereforethe oligopolists' attempt to increase profits could (apart from a redistribution of profitsbetween different sectors of business) lead only to a decline in utilisation. This, on myassumptions, will have an adverse effect on investment decisions, because the firms willbe fearful of increasing excess capacity, even if their total profits have not declined.Consequently, investment will decrease in the following period. The primary setbackto the growth rate will have occurred.An alternative explanation is based on the idea of a 'technological wave' engenderedby a particularly fertile innovation, like the railway, which is followed by a string ofafter-effects (building of new towns, opening up the West) and further innovations,effects which, however, weaken and exhaust themselves after a time (Baran and Sweezy,1966, ch. 8). When I wrote Maturity and Stagnation, I wanted to deny all influence ofinnovations on the accumulation of capital. I think now that this was foolish and Isubscribe to Kalecki's view that innovations are capable of generating a trend. A streamof innovations would be expressed as a shift of the function cp in equation (10).\",\n",

       "  \"8 J. SteindlOn the other hand, this does not mean that I am convinced that the technologicalwave explanation is an adequate substitute for my own explanation. The timing of theexhaustion of this wave remains rather indeterminate: could it not have lasted longer ?It seems that the timing must be strongly influenced by effective demand, so that indefault of other explanations there is still room for my own theory.II. Two phases in the development of post-war historyThe contrast between the post-war full employment era and the pre-war stagnationmust be viewed against the background of great institutional changes. The post-wareconomy has been transformed by the unprecedented role which government, publicpolicy and politics have played. Governments have become more conscious of their rolein the economy and of their responsibilities, and to this extent the influence of Keynesianeconomics on post-war history is undeniable ('full employment as an innovation').In view of the large role of governments, the dominant attitudes and beliefs of publicmen are of some importance for the trend of events. The full employment period wasdominated by growth optimism and by a certain recognition of government responsi-bility for full employment. The subsequent period of stunted growth has been dominatedby a readiness to accept high unemployment and low growth rates. I shall argue that,to a very large extent, the driving force underlying the growth period was the contri-bution of two very distinct elements. First, there was a conscious political and moralreaction against pre-war conditions, particularly in certain European countries. Second,there was the tension between the superpowers which led to large armament spendingand technological competition, as well as to the economic co-operation of the westernindustrial countries under the leadership of the US.In Europe a strong impulse was created by the import of American technology,which acted like a stream of innovations drawn from the available stock of accumu-lated know-how in the US. To the extent to which this was helped by the Marshallplan and technical assistance, it also comes under the heading of international co-operation.In the subsequent period of stunted growth, the driving forces of expansion weakenedwith the relaxation of tension between the superpowers. This is at any rate evident in thefield of international co-operation, currency and trade. At the same time the sustainedgrowth of the previous period had itself produced a reaction which undermined it. Thelong period of accumulation had created a large gap between ordinary replacement ofequipment and depreciation (see Harrod, 1970; Bhaduri, 1972). The increased standardof living and extension of social insurance produced a growth of personal savings, withadverse effects on the rate of profit. The opportunities for introducing new technology inEurope from a ready stock of accumulated know-how in the US began to dwindle. Thetraumatic entry of the environmental and energy problems onto the scene threw anembarrassing burden on industry and government.Finally, full employment and social reform policies led to a growing resentment ofworkers' claims and trade union power. It also led to complaints about work disciplineand to the emergence of stiffer opposition to economic intervention.In fact, the business opposition to full employment policies, which Kalecki had sovividly described in his analysis of the 'political business cycle' (1972), gathered more andmore strength towards the end of the growth period. It seems to have now, however, amore persistent and lasting character than in Kalecki's political cycle, so that we might\",\n",

Budget deficits canonly disappear if private investment soars again. This is unlikely in view of excesscapacity, which would only disappear if there were fiscal expansion.The full employment eraThe arguments will now be spelt out in detail, first for the growth period.Table 1.

Survey of Current Business, National Income Supplement; FederalReserve Bulletin.First, there was an increase in government spending, financed in part by taxation onprofits. As shown above (p. 5), this spending increases capacity utilisation and thusstimulates private investment, as is evident from equation (11). Adverse effects oftaxation were avoided by tax allowances for investing firms.The case of the US may be taken as an illustration (see Table 1). Profit taxes as apercentage of national product were much higher after the war, especially in the 1950s,than before. Budget deficits were lower than before the war, but not so much as tocompensate for the increased taxation of profits. On balance, therefore, the budget wasexpansionist and increased utilisation in industry. This, I maintain, has contributed tothe high post-war investment activity.The bulk of the additional spending in the 1950s was for military purposes. This, infact, was a political pre-condition for the imposition of high profits taxes. Later, militaryspending declined while civilian spending by states and local governments increased.Taxation on profits also declined somewhat (see table).In Europe, in the early stages of post-war growth civilian expenditure, especiallypublic investment, already played a much larger role in the expansion of government\",\n",

       "  \"10 J. Steindlspending In fact, military spending in some countries actually overstrained their alreadyfully employed economies, instead of serving, as it had in the US, to prop up full em-ployment.Secondly, tension between the superpowers led to an intensive technological compe-tition between east and west, having its strongest effects in the decade 1957-68 whichopened with Sputnik and ended with student unrest. The so-called 'competitionof systems' was responsible for a great acceleration in spending on research and develop-ment in the west. Moreover, it set in motion a major educational effort in both the USand western Europe. Although the R & D expenditure (of which half to two-thirds wasfinanced by governments in the US, Britain and France) was to a great extent for mili-tary and space research, its indirect effects on the pace of technological progress ingeneral, and therefore on private investment activity, were considerable. The aftermathof wartime innovation itself provided a great stimulus to industry in the post-war period.This was possible only because of the nature of modern war and the attitude of today'smilitary men. There is hardly an activity in our society which is as thoroughly based onscience as warfare.Third, the post-war tension brought about a close co-operation between the westerncountries under the leadership of the United States. This meant freer trade and aworkable international currency arrangement. Although Bretton Woods (which was asymbol of American dominance) did not really provide that (as Balogh (1973) argued,it had already virtually broken down by 1947), the Marshall Plan and Americanlending made the post-war currency arrangements work up to a point.Successful international co-operation under the Marshall Plan and the OEEC, laterthe OECD, resulted in a vast increase in international trade. It can hardly be stressedenough that this co-operation was a necessary condition for the establishment of highlevels of employment in Europe.Fourth, in Europe a special growth factor was at work, which was only indirectlylinked to the development of international co-operation. After the war many Europeancountries were behind the US in technology. In catching up they were drawing on areadymade stock of know-how, which explains why technological progress and produc-tivity growth were so rapid, much more so than they ever could have been, if the skillshad had to be developed from current expenditure on R & D. The process of import-ing technology was much furthered by the Marshall Plan and by technical assistance,but even more by the general intensification of trade and communications.The spurt of what for Europe were innovations, but in America was common practice,involved a strong stimulus to investment. This stimulus shifted the function <p in equation(10) upwards. The gradual drying up of opportunities for imitation, i.e. the exhaustionof the stock of old skills, meant that the function cp was bound to shift gradually down-wards again.Stunted growthIn the course of the growth period the tension between the superpowers declined. At thesame time there has been a certain shift of economic weight and power away from theUS toother industrial countries and from the industrial to the Third World. As a result,economic co-operation declined. As long as the western countries were dominated by thefear of a common danger, they were prepared to overlook their differences and rallyround a common leader. With the decline of this fear the centrifugal forces in the west\",\n",

       "  \"Stagnation theory and policy 11gained strength. The leading position of the US was impaired by the challenge fromEurope and Japan to its technological supremacy, and by its increasing dependence onforeign energy and materials. A symptom of the decay of US leadership was the formaldismantling of Bretton Woods and the suspension of dollar convertibility.The old world order has really come to an end with the breakdown of unquestionedconfidence in the dollar. Yet there is nothing else taking its place. One is reminded of thesituation at the start of the world depression in the 1930s when, as Kindleberger (1973)notes, Britain ceased to play its role as stabiliser of the economic world system, andnobody else took her place. The stabilising function, according to Kindleberger, wasexercised by counter-cyclical long-term lending, by discounting in times of crisis and bykeeping an open market for distress goods.We are really back in the period before Bretton Woods, when Keynes, Kalecki andSchumacher formulated their international currency plans for a system which wouldnot favour onesidedly the surplus countries and would not have a deflationary bias(Kalecki and Schumacher, 1943). The problems are all there and the solutions havebeen suggested. The surpluses of the OPEC countries and others ought to be channelledinto investment in the poor developing countries by an international bank (Balogh,1973). The same institution ought to be equipped and prepared to step in whenevertrouble develops in the eurodollar market. Stabilisation by buffer stocks ought to beundertaken in commodity markets, in order to eliminate an important source of insta-bility (Kaldor, 1976). The fact that no serious steps are taken in these directions reflectsthe absence of any adequate international co-operation. The present situation directlyand indirectly produces a restrictive climate. The deficit countries are forced into drasticrestrictions and unemployment, while the surplus countries refuse to expand. Protec-tionism develops quietly but irresistibly. The existence of hundreds of billions of dollars of'speculative' funds in the world carries with it the danger of snowballing financialcollapse. It is too much to expect business confidence to thrive on this ground. I nowturn to various negative feedbacks produced by growth over a fairly long period:(1) There is the factor treated by Harrod and BhaduriŠthe difference betweenordinary replacement demand (drop-out of equipment) and depreciation. This differ-ence has increased over the growth period. It means that a lot of new productioncapacity can be created by investing depreciation funds alone. The paradox, observed inGermany, of low net investment in the 1970s and considerable excess capacity might beexplained in this way. Inflation serves to counteract this tendency in so far as it increasesthe current value of the replacement demand. The balance of the two factors is differentin different countries.(2) Many countries show an increasing trend of personal savings as a proportionof disposable income. One hesitates to touch this subject on account of the uncertain-ties of the data. How much of personal saving is really saving of business ? Can onetrust the data, given that saving is a residual? Also consumers' debt is included insavings as a negative term. Yet the impression is that there is really an increase ingenuine household saving, and that it results from growing prosperity. If so, then itshould depress the profit rate and undistributed profits (via a reduction in utilisation),as can be seen immediately from equation (10), if we assume the growth rate of capitalas given. Since it is unlikely that business will increase its indebtedness very much,the increased personal saving would have to be borrowed by the government if restric-tive effects were to be avoided.(3) Since the prosperity of Europe was probably to quite a large extent based on\",\n",

       "  \"12 J. Steindlcatching up technologically with the US, the gradual dwindling of opportunities to drawon this readymade stock of proven and common skills is bound to have strong effects.The rate of growth of output per head cannot remain at its former level in manyEuropean countries. Equally the stimulus for investment emanating from this relativelyeasy and convenient method of technical progress, which is open only to those who arebackward, is bound to decline. In abstract terms we may say that the function cp ofequation (10) has shifted downwards.(4) Environmental and energy problems have come into the consciousness of govern-ment, businessmen and public very abruptly in the late 1960s. One would think that aserious effort to tackle them would require large investment and therefore stimulategrowth of capital, though not of productivity or capacity. It may also be surmisedthat the obligation to find solutions for certain environmental problems in the long runwill have a beneficial effect on technical progress, and 'spin-off' also here, as in militaryresearch. What happens directly, however, is that business, especially in some industries(paper, steel, motorcars), is faced with increasing burdens, although in many cases thesecan be passed on to the consumer.The question of the effects of environment and energy on investment and effectivedemand is highly ambiguous. Whether they will be stimulating or restrictive reallydepends on the wider context of the situation. If a number of other elements favourpessimism and shaken confidence, then so will these factors. Restriction of growth willappear as a method of stemming the tide of increasing energy requirements, and ofever-increasing environmental difficulties. This is how some governments see it, butsince the argument has gained wide currency it may have contributed its share to theerosion of business confidence.(5) The most striking feature of the new economic climate is no doubt the changedattitude of governments towards full employment and growth. The US and Germanywere the first to display this change, but it has gradually spread to other countries as well.The argument of these governments, or their economists, is that the objective circum-stances have changed, and that they are constrained to give up policies which do notwork in the new circumstances. What are these objective changes? In economists' termsthey can be easily described as a shift in the Phillips curve, but what this means in factis not exactly easy to understand, since the Phillips relation is primarily a statisticalrelationship which broke down with the 'wage explosion' of 1969-71. The explanationgiven for this breakdown, or shift, is that trade unions and workers have become moreconscious of price changes and inclined to anticipate them; and that workers as a resultof increased social benefits are less willing to work, consequently voluntary unemploy-ment has increased. (A curious footnote to this phenomenon is that the supply offemale and juvenile labour has increased strongly. Unemployment is concentrated inthese groups, where the new entrants into the labour market do not qualify for assistance.)Thus, it is concluded that higher unemployment is necessary to contain the rise in wageswithin reasonable limits.There are thoseŠlike myselfŠwho cannot agree with these arguments. They findthat the wage 'explosion' is more plausibly explained by the increasing burden ofincome tax and other deductions from wages (see Turner et al., 1972 ;King, 1975). Theyare under the impression that it is not so much objective circumstances which havechanged as political attitudes. This can be explained as a reaction against the longperiod of full employment and growth which has strengthened the economic position ofworkers and the power of the trade unions, and has led to demands for workers' partici-\",\n",

       "  \"Stagnation theory and policy 13pation. It has also led to mass migration (of blacks in the US, of foreign workers inEurope), which has caused turmoil or apprehension of it (in US the race riots of themiddle 1960s, in Europe political resentment and a fear of introducing a new pro-letariat) . This migration has contributed to urban hypertrophy and the crisis of thecities.The political reaction against growth (for which the Club of Rome and ProfessorForrester have written the Bible) has not been confined to sections of big business, andthe banks in particular, but also finds support among large strata of the middle classes(professional people, managers, etc.). This explains why Gerald Ford nearly won the1976 election and why Helmut Schmidt has considerable support for his phlegmaticattitude towards unemployment.The attitudes and policies of governments in turn react on business, including thosesections of it which are not happy with the current trend. Formerly there was a generalconviction in most countries that the government would intervene to prevent a prolongeddepression; this reduced uncertainty and therefore made for higher and more stableprivate investment. This confidence has been shattered. Here is another reason why thefunction cp has shifted downwards.If the reasons 1 to 5 are correct, we must expect low growth for some time to come.Can the economic system adjust itself to a low growth rate ? The upshot of my argumentsin Part I is that it would require a downward shift of the profit function, in other words along-term change in distribution, to get a smooth adjustment to a lower growth rate. Butmy observations on the oligopolistic structure of our economy still hold. Apart fromshort periods, companies do not engage in cut-throat competition, and they protect theirhigh mark-ups. It is therefore likely that the profit function will not shift downwards andthat the weight of the adjustment will be thrown on the degree of utilisation. This willtend to create stagnation.Some observers, such as the European Economic Commission, see the outlook in quitea different light. They anticipate increasing capital coefficients and low profit margins.The reasons for the expected increase in capital coefficients are environmental pro-tection, energy conservation, development of new energy sources and increases in serviceoutputs where high capital coefficients prevail. The arguments are correct, but they donot carry much weight if governments are slow in acting on the energy question and if,because of a reluctance to incur debt or to tax profits, they refrain from building as manyhospitals, schools, etc., as they should.The argument about profits is based on a downward trend of the share of profitsbefore tax in many countries since the 1960s. It has been shown for England and othercountries that this downward trend does not apply to profits after tax (Turner et at.,1972; King, 1975).Of course, profits have been low since the onset of the recession on account of excesscapacity. There is also another long-run influence, namely the increase in non-enterprisesavings, which must tend to depress profits and the degree of utilisation. This can beremedied only by government deficits, unless there is some institutional reform bywhich the outside savings are channelled into the enterprises as 'risk-capital'. As longas such institutions are not created and as long as governments are scared of the increasein public debt, the increase in outside savings does provide a reason for falling profits.But this is not a question of a downward shift of the profit function which would easethe situation. In fact, it only reinforces the tendencies for a decline in utilisation whichflow from the low growth rate and therefore does not contradict my own description.\",\n",
