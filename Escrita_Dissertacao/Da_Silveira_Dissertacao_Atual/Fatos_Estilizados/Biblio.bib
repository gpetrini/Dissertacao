	abstract = {The article analyses the rise in household indebtedness from the point of view of its causes and long-run macroeconomic implications. The analysis is focussed on the US case. Differently from life-cycle interpretations of the phenomenon, and from interpretations in terms of erratic deviations of current income flows from their long-run trend, the rising household debt is viewed as the outcome of persistent changes in income distribution and growing income inequalities. Through household debt, low wages appear to have been brought to coexist with relatively high levels of aggregate demand, thus providing the solution to the contradiction between the necessity of high and rising consumption levels, for the growth of the system's actual output, and a framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution which keeps within limits the real income of the vast majority of society. The question of the long-run sustainability of this substitution of loans for wages is finally discussed. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/usi/wpaper/714.html},
	abstract = {According to the Sraffian supermultiplier model, economic growth is driven by the autonomous components of aggregate demand (exports, public spending and autonomous consumption). This paper tests empirically some major implications of the model. For this purpose, we calculate time-series of the autonomous components of aggregate demand and of the supermultiplier for the US, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and describe their patterns in recent decades. We observe that changes in output and in autonomous demand are tightly correlated, both in the long and in the short-run. The supermultiplier is substantially higher and more stable in the US, while in the European countries it is lower and strongly decreasing. Consistently with theory, we find that where the supermultiplier is reasonably stable - i.e., in the US since the 1960s - autonomous demand and output share a common long-run trend (i.e, they are cointegrated). The estimation of a Vector Error-Correction model (VECM) on US data suggests that autonomous demand exerts a long-run effect on GDP, but also that there is simultaneous causality between the two variables. We propose an explanation based on the idea that autonomous demand is socially and historically determined. We then estimate the multiplier of autonomous spending through a panel instrumental-variables approach, finding that a one dollar increase in autonomous demand raises output by 1.6 dollars over four years. A further implication of the model that we test against empirical evidence is that increases in autonomous demand growth tend to be followed by increases in the investment share. Through Granger-causality tests and instrumental variables analysis, we find that this is the case in all five countries. An additional 1\% increase in autonomous demand raises the investment share by 0.57 percentage points of GDP in the long-run},

	abstract = {Of the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.},

Hence, the principle of effective demand in a growth context, by which a permanent demand shock has a permanent growth effect, is consistent with the stylized fact of a stationary rate of capacity utilization since production capacities are endogenous in the long run.},

Some recent papers have discussed the role of non-capacity generating semi-autonomous expenditures in growth theory. This literature ties together several aspects of heterodox thought: growth and distribution; the Sraffian supermultiplier; Duesenberry's relative income hypothesis; the endogenous money approach and Kalecki–Luxemburg external markets. The basic message is that non-wage sources of effective demand, based on mortgage and consumer credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving long-run output growth. This article gives a broad overview of the role of financed-induced semi-autonomous expenditures in growth, cycles and crises, and thus criticizes some of the previous approaches that claim to mimic actual cycles while abstracting from these crucial determinants of economic activity.},

Segundo a hipótese adotada neste trabalho, são causas deste endividamento a mudança na distribuição de renda (aumento da concentração) e as desregulamentações e inovações financeiras, que se desenvolvem a partir do fim dos anos 1970. Tendo em vista que este aspecto vem sendo bem explorado na literatura especializada, o presente trabalho concentra sua explicação na mudança no padrão de distribuição de renda. Analisando por este prisma, chega-se à conclusão adicional de que não se trata de endividamento das famílias, ou dos consumidores, em geral, e sim, mais especificamente, de uma parcela destes, os trabalhadores norte-americanos, que se endividaram para financiar seus gastos, em um contexto de salários reais estagnados. Por fim, os rumos da economia norte-americana pós-crise são brevemente avaliados.},

The new closure follows from the assumption of the existence of autonomous non-capacity-creating expenditures, which implies that the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save is an endogenous variable whose determination allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the saving ratio without the need for changes in income distribution. Provided it is also assumed that capitalist competition leads to gradual changes in the marginal propensity to invest in order to adjust productive capacity to demand, the new closure (in contrast to the Cambridge and neo-Kaleckian closures) allows us to reconcile demand-led growth, exogenous distribution, and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization.},

Therefore, the German housing system is considered to be operating outside financialized capitalism. Despite Germany’s apparent stability, we argue that an alternative trajectory of financialization in the German housing market can be observed. This trajectory has followed three stages or ‘waves’. The first wave started around the time of German unification and is characterized by the failed attempt of West German banks to marketize and liberalize German housing finance. The second wave started in the late 1990s and is characterized by the ‘financialized privatization’ of many public housing associations and the speculative investments of private equity firms and hedge funds. The third wave started during the global financial crisis and is characterized by booming housing prices and the market entry of listed real estate companies.},

	abstract = {This paper looks at the effect of demand shocks on the investment share of the economy. Using panel data on 20 OECD countries, we show that the rate of growth of autonomous demand (exports, public spending and housing investment) is positively correlated with subsequent values of the share of business investment in GDP. By means of an instrumental-variables strategy, we confirm a positive effect of demand dynamics on the business investment share. We instrument autonomous demand with US demand for imports interacted with exposure to trade with the US, openness to trade of a country’s main export destinations, and military spending. A permanent 1\% increase in autonomous demand growth raises the investment share by 1.5 to 1.9 percentage points of GDP in our preferred panel IV specification. Our results provide empirical support for the view that the influence of aggregate demand on capital accumulation can be a major source of hysteresis. Our results are inconsistent with the canonical New Keynesian 3-equations model, the Neo-Kaleckian model with flexible equilibrium utilization and Classical-Marxian growth models. A positive influence of autonomous demand on the investment share is instead compatible with demand-led models in which capacity adjusts to demand in the long-run.},

Concerns related to supply, particularly at the higher segment of the market, lead these discussions. In this respect, basic regression estimations indicate that over the post-2010 period, income elasticity of house price changes is negative, despite housing being a normal good. In order to reveal the underlying reason, we discuss the role of income distribution. Our empirical analyses suggest that the share of bottom (the top) income quintiles are positively (is negatively) correlated with house price changes. Given the current ample stock of houses, at the high-end of the market, a demand surge led by an increase in the income share of the top income quintile may not put pressure on house prices. In addition, the declining income share of bottom three income quintiles may lead to a reduction in their housing demand. Thus, policies directed to improving income equality might help mitigate the imbalances in the housing market.},

Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a ‘facilitating market’ for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.},

	abstract = {Should housing improvement be part of economic development strategies? Must housing improvement wait until high-economic growth is attained? How much priority should be given to housing in view of the limited resources in less-developed countries? What are housing benefits in economic development vis-à-vis other economic investments? These questions have generated heated debates, both in the literature on development problems and in planning and practice in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper draws on the accumulated body of knowledge resulting from past experiences in research and policy to revisit the earlier debates, survey the main lines of argument and reassess the economic potential of housing. It then attempts to generate broad policy considerations. The main contention of this paper is that in light of past and present evidence, the housing sector needs to be given serious consideration in economic growth strategies.},

Recently, Leamer (2007, 2015) claims that housing activities both predict and cause national business cycles in the US. We investigate his claims for a larger set of countries. We also examine the predictive relationship in multiple resolutions or time scales, namely shortrun and long-run variations of business cycles. Structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) models are estimated to test his more contentious causal claim. Our results show that: (1) housing indicators lead business cycles in most countries; (2) such leading relationship is the most prominent in the long-run. In addition, our SVAR results for the US indicate that housing factors are likely independent drivers of business cycles. Housing starts predict short-run variations in business cycles, while housing prices predict long-run variations better. The cross-country evidences are less certain. Generally, our findings on timescale based relationships between housing and macro economy put restrictions on future models of monetary transmissions.},

After Harrod's seminal paper in 1939 they try to unearth the hidden variables that might allow the adaptation of the warranted rate, determined from the supply side, to demand-growth expectations that supposedly have an autonomous source. The purpose of this paper is to show that an investment function based on the accelerator and integrated in a supermultiplier is able to shape the warranted rate in consonance with the autonomous trend. The supermultiplier reveals itself as a stable and stabilising mechanism when demand is split into permanent and transient. Hopefully the paper will build bridges with other Keynesian, Kaleckian and Sraffian strands that have so far dismissed the supermultiplier solution because of its apparently inherent instability.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between construction activity and economic development at the provincial level in the Peoples’ Republic of China. It also examines variations in the mix of construction outputs among the provinces as they achieve increasing levels of development. It is argued that the analysis of provincial construction outputs and levels of economic development provides additional insights into the debate on the wider relationship between construction activity and economic development as posited by Turin in his seminal studies during the 1960s and 1970s. Since these seminal works many researchers have also sought to explain the relationship between construction activity and economic development. Turin's model is of this relationship and although some studies only provide qualified support for this hypothesis, it is generally agreed that there is a causal link between construction activity and economic development within countries as they develop their economies. Most of these studies have been based on the use of international cross-sectional data from countries at different stages of development to infer an assumed relationship within an individual country over time. In this study, similar data are analyzed to examine these relationships at the provincial level within a large country, each of these provinces being at significantly differing levels of development. Since it adopted policies of economic reform in the late 1970s, China has realized considerable economic progress. However, this has varied significantly among the provinces and regions. Consequently, data demonstrating developments in China's wider economy and its construction activity at the provincial level can be used to test the applicability of the Turin hypothesis within a country that has undergone significant developments over such a short period of time.},

	abstract = {One of the earliest works on the economic significance of the construction industry and its role within the national economy was undertaken by Duccio A. Turin, then London Master Builders' Association Professor of Building at the Building Economics Research Unit, University College London. The quantitative relationships between construction and other important indicators of economic development were depicted for the first time by Turin in 1969. This has since then become one of the most frequently quoted works on the subject. Turin's findings were also adopted subsequently by major international agencies assigned with the task of resolving the problem of underdevelopment in the developing countries. Since Turin's studies some two decades ago, there has so far been no attempt to update the construction-development paradigm along the same format using statistical data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s. For the past 20 years most researchers appear to have assumed that Turin's findings will be ‘more-or-less’ valid. While this supposition may be true to a certain extent, there will inevitably be some discrepancies when Turin's findings are analysed in the modern day context, where technological innovations and the completion of most of the required buildings and infrastructural facilities are expected to exert an influence on the existing relationship between construction and economic development. While this relationship still appears to be valid today, the degree or intensity with which construction and development link may, however, shift from the original quantitative models suggested by Turin. The extent of this suggested shift over time is, however, unknown despite the large number of research studies which have purportedly explored the relationship between construction and economic development over the last two decades. In view of this lacuna, this paper will attempt to replicate Turin's original paradigm for construction and development using data sourced from the 1970s and 1980s.},

	abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x$_{\textrm{t}}$ first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}x\_\{t\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} is already stationary, the time series x$_{\textrm{t}}$ are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector α. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that α becomes a matrix. Interpreting {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}x\_\{t\}=0\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

This paper presents an asset-market model of the housing market and estimates how changes in the expected inflation rate affect the real price of houses and the equilibrium size of the housing capital stock. Simulation results suggest that the accelerating inflation of the 1970s, which substantially reduced homeowners' user costs, could have accounted for as much as a 30 percent increase in real house prices. Persistent high inflation rates could lead ultimately to a sizable increase in the stock of owner-occupied housing.},

	abstract = {Demographic and institutional elements, as important drivers of the housing market, should not be neglected because it is not only financial and monetary elements that matter in the case of the housing market. In this context, one relationship, which still remains unclear, is the relationship between the housing and the labour markets. Some research has been undertaken to support the hypothesis that high rates of homeownership lead to high unemployment via increases in the reservation wage. However, further research is needed to address the possible implications of the institutional settings of the labour market in the dynamics of the housing market. The aim of this paper is to bring some light on the link between both markets. In particular, this contribution explains how the housing cycle could be “amplified” via a new channel, that is, economic precariousness, which is closely related to job insecurity. Subsequently, we provide evidence in the case of five developed economies, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, over the period 1985–2013.},

The results of the evaluation show that the demand components have permanent effects in the long run and that there is a positive causality from final demand autonomous components towards the product. Furthermore, an estimate of both the short and the long run dynamics through an Error-Correction Model is presented. Most empirical studies in which income is determined by demand work with exports-led model à la Thirlwall (1999, 2000). Instead, not only the exports but also both the government and the non-salaried private expenditures are included in this article.},

The results tend to show significant and positive cointegration between these two variables, thus giving support to the BPC-model as a relevant hypothesis to explain Mexico's long-term economic growth. Moreover, the findings of cointegration tests for selected subperiods suggest that the slowdown in its economic growth since 1982 is associated with an increase in the long-term income elasticity of imports that made more binding the balance-of-payments constraint on the expansion of domestic output.},

Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the aggregate French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.},

	abstract = {The 2007 sub-prime crisis in the United States, prolonged by a severe economic recession spread over many countries around the world, has led many researchers to focus on the recent fluctuations in housing prices and their relationships with macroeconomics and monetary policies. The existence of common housing cycles among the countries of the euro zone could lead the European Central Bank to integrate more specifically the evolution of such asset prices in its assessment. In this paper, we implement a multivariate unobserved component model on housing market variables in order to assess the common euro area housing cycle and to evaluate its relationship with the economic cycle. Among the general class of multivariate unobserved component models, we implement the band-pass filter based on the trend plus cycle decomposition model and we allow the existence of two cycles of different periods. The dataset consists of gross domestic product and real house prices series for four main euro area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Empirical results show a strong relationship for business cycles in France, Italy and Spain. Moreover, French and Spanish house prices cycles appear to be strongly related, while the German one possesses its own dynamics. Finally, we find that GDP and house prices cycles are related in the medium-term for fluctuations between 4 and 8 years, while the housing market contributes to the long-termeconomic growth only in Spain and Germany},

We mainly focus on the “pandemic“ view of contagion where local shocks, originating from a country or a local housing market, spread out to other domestic housing markets. An interesting finding is that, even allowing for other channels of international transmission (through global interest rates or activity), the US real house prices, which appear to be exogenous in the US dynamics, unidirectionally causes the international house price factor, which in turn causes the domestic real house price growth for several countries. The channels of contagion from the US appears therefore to be either direct, through house prices (in particular in the UK or Spain), or indirect through other variables.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between consumption and wealth based on the concept of cointegration. The analysis focuses on French data over the 1987 - 2006 period. This relationship is expressed in two ways: in terms of Marginal Propensity to Consume out of wealth (MPC) and in terms of Elasticity of consumption to wealth. Three concepts of consumption are investigated: total households consumption expenditure, consumption excluding financial services and consumption excluding durable goods. Different estimators are also considered. Based on the MPC approach, when considered as permanent by households, an increase (decrease) in total wealth of one euro would lead to an increase (decrease) of 1 cent in total consumption. In terms of elasticity, an increase (decrease) of 10\% in wealth would imply also a relatively small impact of 0.8 to 1.1\% on consumption depending on the concept of consumption considered. In most cases, the effect of a change in financial wealth is bigger than of a change in housing wealth. The results indicate that the wealth effects in France are smaller than in the UK and US but close to what is observed in Italy. In addition, any deviation of the variables from their common trends is corrected at first by adjustments in disposable income in line with what has been uncovered by studies on Germany and consistent with the ”saving for the rainy days” approach of Campbell (1987). But our results contrast with the seminal study of Lettau and Ludvigson (2004) in the US where asset prices make the bulk of the adjustment.},

We find sound evidence in favour of a cointegrating relation, in which both wealth components display the expected, positive effect on households‘ consumption. In particular, our results point to a lower marginal propensity to consume out of housing than out of non housing net worth, with a respective size laying in the range of 1.5-2 and 4-6 cents. Following the estimate of a vector error correction model, we discuss the role played by transitory and permanent shocks in driving changes in the variables we consider. We have found that both consumption and wealth respond almost exclusively to permanent shocks, which are the sole determinants of the common stochastic trend in our theoretical set-up. As a result, we are confident that our estimates of wealth coefficients in the cointegrating vector match very closely the true long run marginal propensity to consume for Italian households.},

We study the impact of the exposure to real estate risk on stock demand. We find that, besides information and transaction costs and risk aversion, housing wealth is a key determinant of stockownership: households facing real estate risk tend to moderate their investments in stocks.

We test this hypothesis using aggregate time series data on FHA and conventional mortgage originations. FHA loans are more expensive for borrowers but provide federal guarantees which protect lenders against default losses. For this reason, FHA loans should be subject to easier credit constraints than conventional mortgages, and the FHA share of mortgage originations should increase with aggregate default risk. Default risk is proxied by a bond rate quality spread consistent with previous studies. Our results imply that default risk-induced mortgage rationing persists in the post disintermediation era, but that FHA programs help offset the overall impact of rationing on housing markets.},
