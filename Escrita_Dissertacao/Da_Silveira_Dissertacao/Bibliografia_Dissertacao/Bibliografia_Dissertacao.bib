	abstract = {El objetivo de este trabajo es discutir algunos aspectos de la teoría de la de-manda efectiva de Kalecki (1971) a partir del análisis del crecimiento de la economía americana en las últimas décadas y particularmente en los años 2000. A lo largo de este período hubo en los Estados Unidos un proceso de creciente concentración de la riqueza y del ingreso funcional y personal. Al mismo tiem-po el consumo agregado crece tanto como proporción del producto (PIB) como en relación a la ingreso disponible de ``las familia'' de modo tal que cada vez es mayor el coro de los que se preocupan con la baja y descendente tasa de ahorro de la economía americana. ¿Será que esto significa que tanto la idea de Keynes, de que los ricos tienen mayor propensión marginal a ahorrar, como la idea ka-leckiana (que viene de Marx) de que la propensión marginal a ahorrar de los trabajadores es bastante menor que la de los capitalistas está equivocada? En este trabajo vamos a avalar la visión de Kalecki sobre este y otros temas anali-zando el crecimiento de la economía americana en este período a partir de una visión sraffiana de crecimiento liderado por la demanda y utilizando en particu-lar la interpretación de Barba \& Pivetti (2008) para la evolución del consumo agregado en Estados Unidos. Además de esta introducción, el trabajo se divide en siete secciones. En la sección II hacemos brevísimas consideraciones gene-rales sobre la compatibilidad de la visión de Kalecki y el enfoque sraffiano. En la sección III presentamos un análisis de la realización de la masa agregada de ganancias en Kalecki llamando la atención sobre el posible papel del crédito al consumidor y de la inversión residencial.

	abstract = {We argue that a fundamental difference between the various post-Keynesian approaches to economic growth lies in their treatment of investment. Neo-Kaleckian models, which are more appropriately Robinsonian models, postulate an investment function dependent on profitability, and that is partly autonomous from income. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models, which are in our view compatible with Sraffian models, place the emphasis on the accelerator in the determination of investment. More importantly, since investment is a derived demand, that is, ruled by the adjustment of capacity to autonomous demand, there is a tendency to a normal level of capacity utilization. These are supermultiplier models. In our view the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in an open economy in the long run. We develop an open economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce wage-led growth, showing that the limit to wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The model is unique in emphasizing the role of income distribution in affecting real exchange rates, and it is through this channel that the ambiguous effects of income distribution on growth arise. We also provide some evidence indicating that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization, and we highlight the role of finance in sustaining expansions suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.},

In a simple closed private one-good economy model, each theory is presented drawing on the relationship between the rate of profit and the rate of growth, as well as on the consideration of one major adjusting variable allowing for the convergence of the endogenous variables of the model to their equilibrium values. This allows for a systematic comparison of exogenous and endogenous variables, of the ‘logic’ or the chain of causalities in each of the approaches, and of the generation of the long-run equilibrium positions of the system. It is finally shown that the post-Kaleckian model is able to cover many but not all of the results generated by the old neoclassical growth model, new neoclassical growth theories, classical–Marxian distribution and growth approaches, and post-Keynesian Kaldor–Robinson and Kalecki–Steindl distribution and growth theories.},

	abstract = {It has long been argued that an increase in inequality increases the rate of economic growth by increasing the share of income going to profit recipients, whose saving contributes to capital accumulation, so that growth is profit-led. A more recent tradition argues that an increase in equality and a rise in the wage share can increase growth by increasing consumption and investment demand, so that growth is wage-led. Bhaduri and Marglin and others argue, however, that even if economic activity is demand-determined, a shift in income distribution towards profits can increase output and growth. This paper examines how a reduction in inequality affects economic growth, thereby contributing to the debate on wage-led and profit-led growth and broadening it to focus on inequality rather than the profit share. It does so by reviewing and re-examining the cases in which workers save, the determinants of investment, and the open economy, three issues that have been emphasized in the literature.},

Some Sraffian economists have long been arguing that the presence of non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures provides a mechanism that brings back the model to normal rates of capacity utilization, while safeguarding the main Keynesian message and without going back to classical conclusions. The present article provides a very simple proof of this, showing within a neo-Kaleckian model that the Harrodian principle of dynamic instability gets tamed by the presence of autonomous consumer expenditures.},

It shows that borrowing by consumers can improve growth prospects in the short run by increasing consumer demand. However, in the longer run the effects of increasing consumer borrowing are ambiguous because, by increasing consumer debt, it redistributes income towards the rich who have a higher propensity to save, thereby possibly depressing aggregate demand and growth despite the borrowing-induced expansion. The problem may be exacerbated by ﬁnancial considerations involving the increase of the interest rate due to greater borrowing, but these considerations are not necessary for it. The problem is more likely to occur when autonomous investment demand is weak, i.e. when borrowing-induced consumption increases are most required to counter tendencies towards stagnation.},

Speciﬁcally, it integrates the Veblenian concept of conspicuous consumption into a typical Bhaduri-Marglin model by assuming that relative consumption concerns matter primarily within the working class. If in such a framework the proﬁt share increases and the corresponding decrease in workers’ income is distributed unevenly, eﬀorts to ”keep up with the Joneses” may increase consumption and, hence, lead to a consumption-driven proﬁt-led regime. The model’s empirical relevance is illustrated with respect to the pre-crisis developments as observed in the U.S.},

Some recent contributions revive an old proposal for solving this problem – making the normal rate of utilization an endogenous variable that converges to the actual utilization rate – justifying it with new, micro-founded premises. We argue that these new justifications for the convergence of normal to actual utilization do not stand closer scrutiny. First, the proposed microeconomic model relies on various restrictive assumptions, some of which are mutually inconsistent. Second, the derivation of the macroeconomic adjustment mechanism from the microeconomic analysis involves a logical leap, that can be justified only by a very arbitrary assumption with little economic justification. Finally, we discuss the way in which this mechanism has been incorporated into the Neo-Kaleckian growth model by proposers of this approach. We show that, even if one puts aside, for the sake of argument, the first two points, the existence of autonomous components of demand is sufficient to invalidate the resulting macroeconomic model.},

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/usi/wpaper/715.html},
	abstract = {Within Post-Keynesian macroeconomic theory, the contribution by Marglin and Bhaduri (Marglin and Bhaduri, 1990; Bhaduri and Marglin, 1990) on the relationship between income distribution and growth has progressively asserted itself as a benchmark model, a reference point that has originated and still gives rise to plenty of theoretical and empirical works. Given this popularity, in the related literature it is often claimed that the only open question left is an empirical one - to assess econometrically whether a particular economy is wage or profit-led. In this essay, I will argue that some theoretical issues, related to this model and to the literature inspired by it, can nonetheless be raised. In particular, the treatment of investment appears to be the least convincing aspect of the approach a là Marglin-Bhaduri. More specifically, it seems possible to raise some doubts about an independent long-run influence of the profit rate or of the profit share on investment, influence that is not in general justified or explained in detail by this literature and that to some extent is simply taken for granted. It will be shown that, if the Marglin-Bhaduri model is integrated with an explicit consideration of the autonomous components of demand, income distribution does not exert any permanent influence on the rate of growth of the economy and on the rate of accumulation. Matching this result with the usual assumption, made in Post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, that capacity utilization is the adjusting variable in equilibrating investment and savings leads to paradoxical results that question the plausibility of an accumulation function like the one used in the Marglin-Bhaduri model.},

Defaults on the principal are also taken into account. We then analyze the theoretical properties of the equilibriums (multiplier effect, stability conditions) resulting from the introduction of this framework in three types of models that differ in regard of who are the debtors and who are the creditors: workers can borrow from capitalists (essay 1) or from their peer (essay 2); capitalists can borrow from their peer (essay 3).},

	abstract = {Our model is based on a Kaleckian basis, which is enriched by three simple, intuitive hypotheses. Firstly, an unemployment benefits system organizes the distribution of the wage bill between employed and unemployed workers, the latter receiving an amount of money corresponding to the subsistence level. Secondly, only individuals with an income above the subsistence level build savings. The combination of these two hypotheses gives rise to an autonomous consumption expenditure whose rate of growth is given by the demographic rate of growth. As a consequence, the rate of capital accumulation spontaneously converges towards the demographic rate of growth (supermultiplier effect), a dynamics that gives a solution to one of the two Harrodian instability problems. The third hypothesis corresponds to the entrepreneurs’ attempts to adjust investment in order to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. Whereas such assumption usually generates knife-edge instability, we show here that this instability can be eliminated by the stabilizing properties of the supermultiplier. Moreover, the attempts to adjust investment enable to restore the normal rate of capacity utilization. In summary, the model offers a simple, simultaneous solution to the two Harrodian instability problems.},

In a stable case, these 'short-period' warranted rates converge to a unique 'long-period' warranted rate, this being determined independently of the rate of growth of autonomous demand. Thus one has a non-steady path of normal output growth. Different rates of growth of autonomous demand engender, for one and the same configuration of normal income distribution, different paths of normal output growth. Moreover, in a circulating-capital-only model with a given constant rate of growth of autonomous demand, different initial rates of growth in aggregate demand also produce different paths of normal output growth. These results point to the importance of effective demand in capital accumulation.},

The closures are shown to have different implications for the behaviour of the rate of capacity utilization and hence whether and how the economy achieves a “fully-adjusted position” (equalization of the actual and normal rates of capacity utilization). Assuming that the normal rate of capacity utilization is exogenously fixed, it is then shown that variation in the actual capacity utilization rate can nevertheless occur – at least within limits – without triggering “Harrodian instability”. This result emanates from a discontinuity in the investment function that is grounded in Harrod’s own macrodynamics, so that it is ultimately the combination of Harrodian and Kaleckian dynamics that gives rise to long-run variations in the actual rate of capacity utilization in the presence of a fixed normal rate. Aggregate and industry-level US capacity utilization data are then used to calculate possible bands within which the rate of capacity utilization may vary without triggering Harrodian instability. A key finding is that the conditions necessary for the latter appear to be relatively rare.},

	abstract = {A recent literature incorporates autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in a medium-run and a longrun Kaleckian growth models. We analyze this literature from the perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier model. From this point of view, traditional Kaleckian growth models have three important limitations: they cannot generate a tendency towards normal capacity utilization; they do not imply a positive relationship between the rate of output growth and the investment-output ratio; and they fail to give a growth-determining role to autonomous non-capacity creating expenditures in the interpretation of real demand-led growth processes. The medium-run model cannot completely overcome all these three limitations and can generate implausible behavior under certain conditions. The long-run model can overcome all three limitations because it combines an investment function based on the capital stock adjustment principle with an endogenous determination of the saving ratio that does not resort to changes in income distribution. Moreover, we argue that an analysis based on the Harrodian instability principle cannot be properly used in the investigation of the stability condition of the Supermultiplier equilibrium of the long-run model. Instead, we suggest that the stability condition of such an equilibrium should be interpreted as a generalized Keynesian stability condition, according to which the propensity to spend should have a value lower than one throughout the whole disequilibrium path of the model.},

First, it provides a simple long‐run equilibrium version and dynamic formulation of the model, and compares it to other models of growth and distribution using a common framework and focusing on the effect of a change in income distribution on growth. Second, it shows that the model can be modified to examine other components of autonomous demand growth, including government spending, exports, consumption by workers, and investment and technical change, and to simultaneous multiple sources of autonomous demand growth. Finally, it comments on some methodological issues concerning the model, and on its implications for the notion of longrun equilibrium.},

The reduced form correlations, third, depend on interactions with the labor market, and a focus on the goods market can be misleading. If, fourth, empirical estimates are taken at face value, the support for wage-led conclusions is much weaker than suggested by the literature.

	abstract = {What determines the rate of growth, the distribution of income, and the structure of relative prices under capitalism? What, in short, makes capitalist economies tick? This watershed treatise analyzes the answers to these questions provided by three major theoretical traditions: neoclassical, neo-Marxian, and neo-Keynesian. Until now, the mutual criticism exchanged by partisans of the different traditions has focused disproportionately on the logical shortcomings of rival theories, or on such questions as whether or not input-output relationships can be described by a continuous-substitution production function. In this book, these are at best secondary issues. The real distinguishing features of the theories, for Stephen Marglin, are their characterization of labor markets and capital accumulation. For clarity, Marglin first sets out the essential features of each theory in the context of a common production model with a single good and a fixed-coefficient technology. He then formalizes the different theories as alternative ways of closing the model. In subsequent chapters he examines the effects of relaxing key simplifying assumptions, in particular the characterization of technology and the homogeneity of output and capital. And although his primary emphasis is theoretical, he does not ignore the problem of empirically testing the theories. Finally, he synthesizes the insights of the neo-Marxian and neo-Keynesian models into a single model that transcends the shortcomings of each taken separately. Marglin anticipates that partisans of the different traditions will agree on one point: each will allow that the book reveals the shortcomings of the other theories but will insist that it fails utterly to reflect the power and majesty of one's own particular brand of truth. Growth, Distribution, and Prices will be controversial, but it will not be ignored.},

The new closure follows from the assumption of the existence of autonomous non-capacity-creating expenditures, which implies that the ratio of the average to the marginal propensity to save is an endogenous variable whose determination allows the marginal propensity to invest to determine the saving ratio without the need for changes in income distribution. Provided it is also assumed that capitalist competition leads to gradual changes in the marginal propensity to invest in order to adjust productive capacity to demand, the new closure (in contrast to the Cambridge and neo-Kaleckian closures) allows us to reconcile demand-led growth, exogenous distribution, and a tendency towards normal capacity utilization.},

The first is the traditional one, according to which the community’s decisions to save in conditions of full utilization of resources (defined so as to allow for a normal succession of booms and slumps) will determine the trend of capital accumulation. This trend of capital accumulation, taken together with the growth of population and the development of technical knowledge, will then determine the trend of aggregate output.},

	abstract = {An endogenous, pro-cyclical capital productivity is motivated by optimizing firm behavior and estimated for a panel of US industries. A positive and significant adjustment parameter has been found relating the growth rate of capital productivity to the difference between the realized utilization rate and the target rate. The endogenous capital productivity is then introduced to a simple Kaleckian growth model with constant rate of utilization in the long run. The effects of shocks to investment, consumption and distribution are studied. We show that the paradox of thrift and the paradox of cost may only hold if Harrodian instability is introduced accompanied by stabilizing counter-forces such as debt dynamics.},

We provide an exposition of the underlying theory of wage- and profit-led growth. We emphasize the implications of possible non-linearities in the determination of the final equilibrium and why—because of them—a redefinition of the concept of wage- and profit-led economy is necessary. We estimate the demand and distribution schedule for the US economy using a two-stage least squares approach. Our findings confirm the hypothesis of a non-linear distribution schedule and therefore the need to redefine the concepts wage- and profit-led growth.},
